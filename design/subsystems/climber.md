# Climber

## Assumptions
* Robot is physically capable of climbing on deep
climb without breaking any
rules.
* Robot battery has enough amperage to supply power for
the entire climb, and the climb will be balanced after
being disabled. The motors do not need to be actively holding
the climb. However, the motors MAY be in break mode.

## Operations
`climbDeep`
* Begins to activate whatever mechanism is responsible for
climbing the deep cage.
