# Climber

## Assumptions
* Robot is physically capable of climbing on deep
climb *and* shallow climb, without breaking any
rules.
* Robot battery has enough amperage to supply power for
the entire climb, and the climb will be balanced after
being disabled.

## Operations

* Begins to activate whatever mechanism is responsible for
climbing the deep cage.
