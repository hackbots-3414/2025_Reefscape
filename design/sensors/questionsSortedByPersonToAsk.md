### Priorities:
- <span style="color:red">Zero</span>
- <span style="color:yellow">One</span>
- <span style="color:green">Two</span>
- <span style="color:purple">Answered</span>

### Chris:
- <span style="color:yellow">Has he been looking into absolute encoders for the lift? </span><span style="color:purple"> Yes. Can coder on shaft for lift. May be Lidar sensor as well.</span>
- <span style="color:green">Would they be accurate enough to measure by?</span><span style="color:purple"> Yes.</span>

### Design:
- <span style="color:yellow">Does Algae end up pressing against a wall or something for touch sensor to detect?</span><span style="color:purple"> No. IR sensor or motor current voltage for that one.</span>
-<span style="color:red">What climb tactic is being used?</span><span style="color:purple"> Climbing via funnel rather than donut.</span>
    - IF FUNNEL CLIMB:
        - <span style="color:yellow">Is there a motor involved in climbing using the funnel?</span><span style="color:purple"> Yes</span>
           -  <span style="color:yellow">Can we track its current usage?</span><span style="color:purple"> Yes, we can track current usage.
- <span style="color:red">What sensors are you already planning on putting on the robot, if any?</span><span style="color:purple"> Magnetic sensor on the elevator. Otherwise, Programming must ask for them.</span>

### Mechanical/Electrical:
- <span style="color:red">How much can the cage spin on its chain?</span><span style="color:purple"> It rotates a lot, but it returns to its original position (Rotates back very slowly)</span>

### Experienced Driver: Never mind - No donut climb
- IF CAD SAYS DONUT CLIMB:
    - <span style="color:yellow">Would being able to switch between robot and field centric navigation be prohibitively confusing for a driver?</span>
        - For precise navigation of donut climb via camera

### Ask Nolan AFTER HE FIGURES OUT APRILTAGS:
- <span style="color:green">Are there any 'dead zones' where we can't see any AprilTags or can't accurately detect their location? (Especially while under the barge)</span> 
### Test:
- <span style="color:red">With belts on Coral intake, would motor current change enough to be readable with Coral intaked?</span> <span style="color:purple"> Yes, but we won't be able to tell where exactly the coral is within the intake.</span>
- <span style="color:green">Would the CANcoders reset on robot boot?</span><span style="color:purple"> No.</span>
