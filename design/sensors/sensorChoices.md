- <span style="color:purple">Already decided by mechanical/electrical</span>
- <span style="color:red">Must be asked for in order to get</span>
- <span style="color:green">No more action needed</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Must wait for outside testing to be done</span>
- <span style="color:yellow">Unclear/uncertain</span>

### Elevator:
- <span style="color:purple">CANcoder</span> & <span style="color:red">Lidar sensor</span> (facing up to detect when elevator is at zero and at top) OR <span style="color:red">Lower and Upper Limit Switch</span> - Necessary because the CANcoders will loop and have multiple zeros.

### Algae:
- <span style="color:green">Motor Current</span>

### Coral:
- <span style="color:red">Several IR sensors</span> in funnel or in rollers (<span style="color:yellow">Ask about path coral is going to be taking/where the coral is going to be stored while in transit.</span>) Used for telling where the coral is in the rollers. Two IR. One to check to make sure it isn't sticking out the front, one to check if it's sitting in the middle.
- <span style="color:green">Motor Current</span> to see if we have grip on coral.

### Climber:
- <span style="color:green">Motor Current</span>
- <span style="color:red">Switch</span> to confirm contact

### Navigation:
